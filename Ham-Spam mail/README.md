## HAm-SPam Mail  

The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have 
been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages 
in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

This corpus has been collected from free or free for research sources at the Internet:

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. 
This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, 
most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the 
text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully 
scanning hundreds of web pages.
-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), 
which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of 
Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from
Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University.
